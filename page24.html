In order to graduate and receive your diploma all requirements must be completed no later than June 2009. This means you need to successfully defend your dissertation (D7 form) and have all committee and appropriate department members sign and approve your Thesis Approval form. In addition, the Completion form needs approval from your department, the Thesis Format Reviewer, Library and Graduate Studies Office.<br />The initial submission to the Thesis Format Reviewer is May 2009 and the final submission deadline is May 2009. Your initial submission can be before your final defense date, however you must defend your thesis prior to May 2009 in order to submit your thesis for final review. The completed Thesis Approval form needs to be submitted with your thesis for review. This is necessary to move through the final clearance process. Once your thesis has been approved by the format reviewer, you must submit it to the library for binding (this process can be completed in a few hours). Finally, submit the approved Completion Form to the Graduate Studies Office (3201 Arch St, Suite 100) for approval and clearance for degree. The absolute deadline for submitting the approved Completion Form to the Graduate Studies Office to be cleared for graduation is June9, 2009.<br />In the case that you successfully defend your thesis prior to June 8th and have not completed the format review process or library submission, than you can walk through graduation. Walk through means that you can attend the ceremony in full regalia, have your name called on stage and have your supervising professor hood you on stage. However, since you have not finished all the requirements you will not receive a diploma on June 2009. Please note that diplomas are not distributed on stage so it will not be apparent that you are a walk through. Diplomas are picked up at a remote location. Once you have completed all requirements (thesis review and library submission) then your diploma will be released with a June 11, 2009 graduation date. An extension of 2-3 weeks after commencement is allotted to finish these requirements. If you do not complete your requirements by July, 2009 then you will become a summer degree candidate with a graduation date of September 2010.<br /></span><span style="font:15px Calibri; "><br /><br /></span><span style="font:15px Calibri; ">Application for degree: http://www.drexel.edu/404.aspx?aspxerrorpath=%2f404.aspx<br />Forms needed for final defense:<br />1.
