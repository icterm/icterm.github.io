In conjunction with industrial partners, SEE seeks to develop a portfolio of cutting-edge, biotechnology-based surgical devices that will rapidly enter the surgical realm and enhance patients&rsquo; quality of life.<br /><br />As a forward thinking initiative, SEE includes research and development, education and patrient-care components. SEE represents a prime example of translational biotechnology programs that draw on existing Drexel strength and is poised to propel the University into a leadership role within multiple arenas of surgical engineering.<br /></span><span style="font:15px Calibri; "><br /></span></p><p style="text-align:center;"><img class="imageStyle" alt="IMG_0523_2" src="files/img_0523_2.jpg" width="467" height="218"/><span style="font:15px Calibri; "><br /></span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="font:15px Calibri-Bold; font-weight:bold; font-weight:bold; ">The TEAM</span><span style="font:15px Calibri; "><br />As part of its Strategic Initiative, Drexel&rsquo;s College of Medicine is developing a research and training program in surgical engineering, the Surgical Engineering Enterprise (SEE). </span><span style="font:15px Calibri; "><a href="http://www.drexelmed.edu/Home/AboutOurFaculty/BarryWaterhouse.aspx" rel="self">Barry Waterhouse, Ph.D.</a></span><span style="font:15px Calibri; ">, Vice Dean for Biomedical Graduate and Postgraduate Studies, oversees and coordinates the activities of this program.

The unique environment at Drexel provides surgeons and other clinicians the opportunity to collaborate with engineers and biologists in the development of novel devices and minimally invasive procedures that aid in the diagnosis, treatment and repair of diseased or injured tissue.<br /><br />The initial research goal of the Drexel Surgineering</span><span style="font:11px Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#262626;">&trade;</span><span style="font:15px Calibri; ">program is to develop tissue engineering and biotechnology-based tools for regenerative joint repair, such as bioactive interference screws and porogen-based personalized bone constructs.<br /><br />These surgical smart tools will aid in the repair and healing of some of the most common musculoskeletal problems, including anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and rotator cuff injuries, as well as failed total joint replacements.<br /><br />In addition to the lead research program focusing on biotechnology-based regenerative joint repair, the SEE initiative comprises a variety of educational and translational components, providing the blueprint for the development of other seminal advances in surgical care.
