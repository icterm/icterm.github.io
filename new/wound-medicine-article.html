<p>RESTON, Va., May 28, 2014 /PRNewswire/ – Eqalix, Inc. today announced the results of a pre-clinical study on its novel electro-spun soy protein-based tissue scaffold, OmegaSkin™ wound dressing, suggesting enhanced tissue generation in a pig model of full thickness excisional wound healing. The study was conducted at the Temple University Institute of Regenerative Medicine and Engineering (TIME) in Philadelphia. </p>

<p>The Wound Medicine online edition publication, “Electrospun Soy Protein Scaffolds as Wound Dressings:  Enhanced Reepithelialization in a Porcine Model of Wound Healing,” authored by scientists in the laboratory of Peter I. Lelkes, Ph.D., Director of TIME, compared wounds dressed with OmegaSkin™ with control wounds dressed with a currently marketed product.</p>

<p>The study found that while the overall rate of wound closure was similar in wounds dressed with OmegaSkin™ compared to control wounds, there were significant qualitative differences. Two weeks after a single application at the time of wounding, the OmegaSkin™-treated wounds showed robust signs of reepithelialization, which was absent in the control wounds. After 4 weeks, the OmegaSkin™-treated wounds contained an epithelial layer in the epidermis that appeared essentially normal, while the connective tissue in dermis was attaining a cellular, organized appearance. By contrast, the nascent epidermis of the control wounds appeared immature, while the dermis was still replete with numerous inflammatory/immune cells. Standard staining confirmed the increased presence of collagen in the dermis of the OmegaSkin™-treated wounds at 4 weeks, while the control wounds were largely devoid of collagen. Finally, in addition to enhanced reepithelialization and dermal tissue regeneration 4 weeks after application of the OmegaSkin™ dressing, dermal appendages such as sweat glands and hair follicles were observed, while no such appendage formation was observed in the control wounds.   </p>

<p>Dr. Lelkes elaborated that, “Taken together, the histological data indicated that OmegaSkin™ promoted a more natural mode of tissue regeneration in this porcine model of full thickness excisional wound healing. Given the similarities between porcine and human wound healing, we anticipate that OmegaSkin™ may also be advantageous in human applications.”</p>

<p>Mr. Thomas Seoh, Eqalix President and Chief Executive Officer, stated that, “In addition to the possibility that OmegaSkin™ may promote more physiologic healing of wounds, we believe that applying this scalable industrial manufacturing process of electro-spinning to a “green” renewable source like the soybean plant may be able to cut costs significantly, extend availability and shelf life without the need for refrigeration, avoid procurement and processing of animal and human tissues and eliminate the risk of immunogenic reactions and disease transmission from animal and human products.”</p>

<p>The Company plans to file appropriate product applications with the Food and Drug Administration and other regulatory bodies to obtain marketing approval for the management of a range of chronic ulcers and other wounds.</p>
