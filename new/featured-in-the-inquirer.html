          <p>The lab’s research on soy-based scaffolds is featured today in an <a href="http://articles.philly.com/2014-04-06/news/48912149_1_soy-protein-chinese-restaurant-skin" title="Link to the article">article</a> in the Philadelphia Inquirer. </p>

<p>We provide a copy of the article below, for archival purposes.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="soy-based-skin-substitute-shows-promise">Soy-based skin substitute shows promise</h4>

<p><img src="/img/omegaskin-inky.jpg" alt="Temple University professor Peter Lelkes and assistant professor Yah-el Har-el with a sheet of Omegaskin, a wound dressing made from soy protein." title="Temple University professor Peter Lelkes and assistant professor Yah-el Har-el with a sheet of Omegaskin, a wound dressing made from soy protein." /></p>

<p><strong>Tom Avril, Staff Writer.</strong> </p>

<p>The plate at the restaurant in Beijing was laden with thin, yellowish sheets made from soybeans, called tofu skin.</p>

<p>Peter Lelkes used them as the chef intended, to wrap vegetables into bite-size morsels.</p>

<p>But as he ate, the biomedical engineer’s thoughts strayed from the Chinese restaurant to his lab in Philadelphia. The tofu-based “skin,” he realized, made him think of the real thing.</p>

<p>A decade later, that chance encounter in a Chinese restaurant has led to a soy-based “skin substitute” - a wound dressing that a start-up company has licensed for use on diabetic ulcers, burns, and other injuries the body cannot readily heal on its own.</p>

<p>Lelkes and his Temple University colleagues say the product has shown promise in animal studies, and the company, Eqalix in Reston, Va., is raising money to seek FDA approval.</p>

<p>The soy-based material, made with sophisticated technology that bears no resemblance to what happens in a Chinese restaurant, does not literally take the place of skin. Instead, it appears to act as a “scaffold” to promote skin growth, eventually dissolving into the wound in the process.</p>

<p>“This is not a Band-Aid,” said Lelkes, a native of Hungary who plays violin and viola. “This is bioactive.”</p>

<p>Skin substitutes have been on the market for nearly two decades. But existing products are made with cells, collagen, or other components from human or animal tissue, and can be expensive due to manufacturing safeguards needed to prevent infection.</p>

<p>If approved, the soy product would be a low-cost alternative at an opportune time. As of January, Medicare has changed how it reimburses hospitals for skin substitutes, using “bundled” rates that may not cover the cost of higher-end products.</p>

<p>Long before he could think about licensing his idea, however, Lelkes had to convince colleagues that he was not crazy.</p>

<h5 id="a-velvety-mat">A velvety mat</h5>

<p>The dish Lelkes ate in Beijing in 2003, yuba, is made by boiling soy milk, then removing and drying the skin that forms on the surface.</p>

<p>The result is sort of “crumbly,” said Lelkes, then at Drexel University. If he was going to use soy protein to promote wound healing, he knew he would need something more sophisticated.</p>

<p>Back in his lab, Lelkes thought the idea might be a hard sell with colleagues. He was right.</p>

<p>“They said, ‘You must be nuts,’ “ he recalled.</p>

<p>Undeterred, he started to work with a process called electrospinning. Developed by the textile industry in the early 20th century for weaving synthetic fibers, electrospinning has been explored more recently for biomedical applications.</p>

<p>The process Lelkes developed starts with a product called soy isolate, an edible powder sold in health food stores. It is mixed with an organic solvent and then fed through a syringe with a pump.</p>

<p>As it leaves the syringe, the mixture is drawn electrically through the air toward a metallic target, such as aluminum foil, which is connected to a voltage generator.</p>

<p>The solvent evaporates in the process, leaving a thin, velvety mat of soy protein on the foil. Lelkes, a professor in both the medical and engineering schools at Temple, demonstrated the process recently with a crew of graduate students and colleague Yah-el Har-el, an assistant professor of bioengineering.</p>

<p>“You end up with an interlaced mesh of fibers,” Har-el said.</p>

<p>Studies in pigs suggest the soy product promotes more natural healing with less inflammation and scar tissue, apparently due to “bioactive peptides” in the plant-based protein, said Lelkes, who came to Temple in 2012.</p>

<p>Ari Brooks, a Pennsylvania Hospital surgeon who has used animal-based skin substitutes, said the soy-based product was intriguing. Brooks and Lelkes used to have labs near each other, so the surgeon got to see the research up close.</p>

<p>“He’s very brilliant,” Brooks, chief of endocrine and oncologic surgery at Pennsylvania Hospital, said of Lelkes.</p>

<p>Eqalix officials said they could not yet forecast the exact cost of the soy product, called Omegaskin, but predicted it would be far cheaper than the high end of the market. Some products cost hundreds of dollars per square inch.</p>

<p>Before this year, Medicare paid hospitals a different price for each of more than 50 skin substitutes on the market. The agency now bundles the cost of the material into a low or a high rate that also includes the fee paid to the hospital.</p>

<p>The low rate is about $400 for wounds up to 25 square centimeters (about four square inches). The high rate is about $1,370 for the same amount of material.</p>

<p>The new rates do not cover the cost of some high-end products, said Dea Kent, a certified nurse practitioner in Indianapolis and secretary of the Wound Ostomy and Continence Nurses Society, a professional group.</p>

<p>“We are having to make some really tough decisions based on health-care costs,” said Kent, speaking on her own behalf and not the society’s.</p>

<p>So are some manufacturers. Shire P.L.C., which has operations in the Philadelphia area, sold assets of its skin-substitute unit in January, citing the Medicare change.</p>

<p>Kent said the various products were not all alike. Some may be more useful for burns, others for diabetic foot ulcers.</p>

<p>Yet there are few randomized controlled trials comparing the effectiveness of the products, according to a 2012 report by the ECRI Institute, a nonprofit research organization in Plymouth Meeting.</p>

<p>Eqalix officials plan to seek approval for the soy product through an FDA process that requires, among other things, a demonstration of a safe manufacturing process and evidence that the product is substantially equivalent to what is on the market.</p>

<p>That process would take at least a year, officials said.</p>

<p>One thing is clear. It would be the only skin substitute inspired by a Chinese restaurant.</p>
